The structure of the Compose file
The compose file reference documentation is layed out following the structure of the Compose file. The main chapters in the docs are related to the top-level entries of the Compose file, these are the following as of today:

version - specifies the version of the Compose file reference, you have seen it in the example.
services - specifies the services in your application, we used it in the example.
networks - you can define the networking set-up of your application here, we’ll see an example in a minute.
volumes - you can define the volumes used by your applicaiton here, we’ll see an example.
secrets - secrets are related to Swarm mode only, you can use them to provide secret information like passwords in a secure way to your application services.
configs - configs lets you add external configuration to your containers. Keeping configurations external will make your containers more generic. Configs is available both in Compose and in Swarm mode.
